# FRAUD-DETECTION-ALGORITHIM
Fraud Detection algorithm focused on building a robust fraud detection system using Machine Learning techniques. It aims to identify fraudulent activities in financial transactions and minimize false positives.

# Project Highlights :

Implementation of random forest and XGBoost models.

Achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 98%.

Real-time detection and alert system.

Robust data preprocessing and feature engineering.

# Project Aims :

-> The main goal is to accurately identify and block unauthorized or suspicious transactions in real-time, thus preventing financial losses for both customers and financial institutions.

-> Implement robust security protocols and systems to safeguard sensitive financial data and protect against potential fraud.

-> Strike a balance between identifying real fraud cases and reducing the number of legitimate transactions mistakenly flagged as fraudulent, ensuring a smooth customer experience.

-> Ensure the system adheres to financial regulations and data privacy laws, such as GDPR and PCI-DSS, to maintain trust and legal compliance.
